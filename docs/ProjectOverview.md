Project Overview
1. System Objectives
    The main objective of the Inventory Asset Tracking System for Mindoro State University Main Campus is to provide the Supply and Property Services Office with a centralized, automated platform to accurately track, monitor, and manage all physical assets—including equipment, furniture, electronics, vehicles, and supplies—throughout their lifecycle, ensuring enhanced asset accountability, maintenance efficiency, and compliance with institutional policies.
    This objective aligns directly with the scope of covering all physical assets managed by the university’s Supply and Property Services Office, enabling them to maintain real-time visibility and control over inventory, reduce losses, facilitate timely maintenance, and support audit and reporting requirements effectively.

2. Proposed Scope
    The system will cover all physical assets owned or managed by Mindoro State University - Main Campus, including equipment, furniture, electronics, vehicles, and supplies.
